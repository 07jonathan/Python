Explanation

    Import NumPy: We import the NumPy library, which provides the std and mean functions.
    Define Function: We define a function calculate_standard_deviation that takes a list of speed values, calculates the mean and standard deviation, and prints them.
    Example 1: We call the function with the first set of speed values.
    Example 2: We call the function with the second set of speed values.
